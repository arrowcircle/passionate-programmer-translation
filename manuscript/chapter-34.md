#### 34. Adventure Tour Guide

<!--
At the risk of stating the obvious, the most important aspect of getting the 
word out in the workplace is your ability to communicate. Gone are the days of 
the disheveled hacker crouching over his terminal and coding by the light of 
his monitor in the deepest bowels of the server room. The occasional 
monosyllabic grunt between feats of wizardry isn’t gonna cut it.

<!--
As disturbing a proposition as it may be, put yourself into the mind of
a manager or _customer_ (I’ll just use the word customer throughout this
section to refer to both).
--!>



<!--
They’re responsible for something gravely important that they ultimately have 
to entrust to some scary IT guys for implementation. They do what they can to 
help move things along, but ultimately they’re at the mercy of these 
programmers. Moreover, they have no idea how to control them or even to 
communicate intelligently about what it is that they’re doing. In this 
situation, what’s the most important attribute they’ll be looking for in a 
team member? I’ll bet you the price of this book it’s not whether they’ve 
memorized the latest design patterns or how many programming languages they 
know.

<!--
_They’re going to be looking for someone who can make them comfortable about
the project they’re working on._

<!--
*Your customers are afraid of you.*
--!>



<!--
These managers and customers we’re talking about have a dirty little secret: 
they are _afraid_ of you. And for good reason. You’re smart. You speak a cryptic 
language they don’t understand. You make them feel stupid with your sometimes
sarcastic comments (which you might not have even intended to be sarcastic). 
And, your work is often the last and most important toll gate between a 
project’s conception and its birth.

<!--
Your job is to be your customer’s tour guide through the unforgiving terrain 
of the information technology world. You will make your customers comfortable 
while guiding them through an unfamiliar place. You will show them the sights 
and take them where they want to go while avoiding the seedy parts of town 
you’ve encountered in the past. Nonprogrammers are, on the average, as 
intelligent as programmers. (That is to say that most of them aren’t very 
intelligent, but a few of them really are.) Chances are high that your customer 
is just as smart as you but just doesn’t happen to know how to program a 
computer.  That’s OK. You probably don’t know how to do much of what he or she 
does on a daily basis. That’s why there are two of you, and you’re both being 
paid to come to work.

<!--
I mention the bit about intelligence because computer people all too often 
assume that anyone who doesn’t know how to operate a computer is not 
intelligent. Saying it explicitly like this makes it sound idiotic, but that’s 
true of all prejudices. However, this feeling is so ingrained in many of us 
that we don’t even know when we’re feeling it. Explicitly trying to control it 
doesn’t work.
--!>



<!--
My advice is to reverse the relationship. Instead of feeling like you are the 
computer genius, descending from computer heaven to save your poor customer 
from purgatory, turn the tables around. If you’re, for example, working in the 
insurance industry, think of your customer as a subject matter expert in 
insurance from which _you_ have to learn in order to get _your_ job done.
--!>



<!--
That being said, you need to be cognizant that your customers may need topics 
toned down a bit when you’re discussing software-related matters. There’s a 
delicate balance between too techie and too dumb.

<!--
“Why all this talk of how to treat your customers? I thought we were going to 
talk about how to market myself.” If you work in a typical IT shop, much of the 
budget that keeps you gainfully employed comes from a business function—the 
same business function for which your customers work and influence decisions. 
When promotion and staffing decisions are being made, the best advocate you can 
have is a customer who doesn’t want to live without you. On the flip side, 
imagine the impact of a customer who thinks you are condescending. Your 
customer represents the needs of the business, and you are paid to provide for 
those needs. Don’t forget this.

##### Act on It!
--!>



<!--
  1. _Check yourself_ —Are you the grumpy old code ogre everyone fears? Are 
  you _sure_? Are they afraid to tell you? Go through your mailbox, and find 
  examples of e-mails that you have sent to less-technical co-workers, 
  managers, and customers. As you read through, try to see things from the 
  recipient’s perspective. If some time has passed since sending the messages, 
  you’ll be able to see yourself as a third-party observer would.  Even better, 
  show the e-mails to your mom. Tell her that someone you work with sent the 
  messages to a customer, and ask her how the messages would make _her_ feel.

<!--
  2. _Hop the fence_—Find an opportunity to be flung into a situation in which 
  you are not the expert and are thus dependent on others who are.  If you have 
  two left feet, imagine yourself on a soccer team. If you have two left 
  thumbs, imagine that you’re part of the National Knitting Team. How would you 
  like your teammates to communicate with you?
